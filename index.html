                <h3>Not so much reality.</h3>
                <p>
                    If you're looking to get rich or wealthy overnight you are in the wrong place. Not just
                    this one I'm afraid but nearly everywhere else on the internet too. Well, that said it's
                    not impossible either. You can always purchase a good thriving website on flippa.com and
                    either sell it or make money from it, wait for it... Overnight! Yes, if you're lucky...
                    But if you are like me at the beginning of my journey or as the majority of people
                    searching "How to make money online" I bet financial resources are not humongous. So the
                    freebie side of making money online takes time. It certainly doesn't come overnight.
                    (There is a but) BUT, if you are willing to invest a certain amount of you're time and
                    stick with your projects (don't hop to a different one each other day) there is hope!

                <h3>Reality.</h3>
                <p>
                    Luckily for us, the reality is not very complicated. As mentioned in the more depressive
                    card on the left, it takes time, a little bit of a learning curve (depends on what
                    you're getting in to) and some common sense. Look at making money online the same way as
                    growing a plant or a tree. You always start with planting the seed. Depending on the
                    route you are taking or what niche you are going for this will be most likely getting
                    your actual website, blog or any other project online. Now, the seed has sprouted and
                    needs nutrients, water, love, and attention. You can compare this stage with feeding
                    your beloved project some articles, or how about learning SEO (search engine
                    optimization) to get your site ranked high in the search results! And of course, we all
                    need traffic... Then, after all of this, we finally get to the blooming stage. Where all
                    of our hard work results in a beautiful moneymaking tree! Ok, enough about the story.
                    You can see where I'm going with this. Be patient you will be rewarded, that's reality.
